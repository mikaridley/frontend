## 📋 Recommended Board Layout

Marshmello works best when you follow our "Smooth Flow" organization:

| Column          | Purpose                                               |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resources**   | Links, brand assets, and API documentation.           |
| **Icebox**      | Ideas and "later" features not yet in the sprint.     |
| **To Do**       | Tasks ready for immediate development.                |
| **In Progress** | Tasks currently being coded or designed.              |
| **Blocked**     | Tasks stuck due to dependencies or external feedback. |
| **QA / Review** | Tasks requiring testing or code review.               |
| **Done**        | Tasks that are 100% completed and toasted.            |
